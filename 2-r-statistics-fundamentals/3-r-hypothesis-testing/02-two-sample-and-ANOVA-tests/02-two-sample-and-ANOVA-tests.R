# Problem: The CEO of a telecommunication company called a stakeholders meeting. He had this intuition that 
# he just needs to focus on those who stay and retain them because the revenue from the those who stayed is obviously
# be more than those who churned. 73% stayed is way higher than 27 churned, right?

# However, you interrupted (just kidding) the CEO saying that we should better be sure than sorry. ðŸ˜…
# The CEO is assuming that the generated revenue from each of the two groups are proportionally distributed.

# What if the company actually generates more money from those 26% of customers who left? 
# And they left because they subscribed to something unreasonably expensive?
  # Other underlying questions for future analyses based on this initiative are:
    # Should we win them back? 
    # Are there similar behaviors among the churned customers, similar reasons for churning, 
    # that we should look out for those who stayed, so we can retain them?


# T-TEST

# To answer the question, you should to an independent two-sample t-test: 
# This test is used to compare the means of a variable for two groups that are independent of each other.

# In a t-test, you should obtain the t-statistic (also known as the t-value). It is a measure that quantifies 
# the difference between the means of two groups and indicates the likelihood of observing such a difference by chance alone.

# Data Scientist sets up the hypothesis:
# H0: MuRevenueChurned <= MuRevenueStayed
# Ha: MuRevenueChurned > MuRevenueStayed

# Get the unique Customer.Id values
customer_churn %>% 
  distinct(Customer.ID)

# To obtain the t-statistic, we need 6 numbers:
#   mean1 is the mean of the first group
#   mean2 is the mean of the second group
#   s1 is the standard deviation of the first group
#   s2 is the standard deviation of the second group
#   n1 is the degrees of freedom of observations in the first group
#   n2 is the degrees of freedom of observations in the second group

# The degrees of freedom for a t-test is equal to the number of observations in the data set minus 2.

# The hypothesis test for determining if there is a difference between the means of two populations uses 
# a different type of test statistic to the z-scores. It's called "t", 
# and can be calculated from three values from each sample using this equation.

# The sample means for the two groups are available as xbar_stayed - xbar_churned. 
# The sample standard deviations are s_stayed and s_churned. The sample sizes are n_stayed and n_churned.


# Calculate the numerator of the test statistic
numerator <- xbar_stayed - xbar_churned

# Calculate the denominator of the test statistic

# Calculate the test statistic

# Print the result

# Print the result
print(p_value)

# There is strong evidence to support the alternative hypothesis that the mean revenue for the "Churned" 
# group is indeed greater than the mean revenue for the "Stayed" group.

# Since the p-value is very low, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically 
# significant difference between the two means. 

# The observed difference between the means is likely due to chance (being xbar_churned < xbar_stayed).





# REVERSING THE HYPOTHESIS FORMULATION


# H0: MuRevenueChurned >= MuRevenueStayed

# Calculate the p-value from the test stat
p_value <- pt(t_stat, df = degrees_of_freedom, lower.tail = TRUE)

# Print the result
print(p_value)

# There is not enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis that the mean revenue for the "Churned" 
# group is indeed less than the mean revenue for the "Stayed" group.

# Since the p-value is high, we cannot reject the null hypothesis and we can
# conclude that there is no statistically significant difference between the two means.

# The observed difference between the means is in the opposite direction of what we expected (being xbar_churned < xbar_stayed), 
# but this is probably just by chance and not statistically significant.

# Problem: The CEO wishes to determine if there are certain internet types that generate more revenue, so he consulted
# you as the company Data Scientist on how to determine if there are certain types of internet that the company should
# focus on for the marketing team's efforts.

# Q:
# Is the average total revenue different for different internet types?

# Take a peak of the data about the total revenue for each of the different internet types

# Fiber Optic looks like it generates more revenue than the others. 
# Q: Should we immediately tell the marketing team
# to focus their marketing effort on this internet type to generate more sales and revenue?

# A: Not yet. As a Data Scientist, you have to verify if it is really significantly different.
# You need to do a hypothesis test

# To determine the significance of the average total revenue per internet type having 3 available categories, you
# will need to use ANOVA. 

# Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical test that is used to compare the means of two or more groups.

# ANOVA is a powerful tool that can be used to test a variety of hypotheses about the differences between groups. 
# It is often used in the social sciences, medical sciences, and business to compare the effects of different treatments 
# or interventions.

# in the revenue generated but does not tell which internet types

# Perform Pairwise T-Test to further support the ANOVA methodology on determining which among the internet types
# have significant differences when it comes to the total revenue generated

# A Pairwise T-Test is a statistical test that is used to compare the means of two groups that are paired together.
# To compare all three, the Pairwise T-Test will conduct 3 tests to hypothesis test all possible pair combinations
# of internet type.
# Generally, the number of tests a Pairwise T-Test is C(n, 2) = n*(n-1)/2 or  num_categories C 2

# The result shows a matrix of 3 p-values
# Two of them is less than the alpha of 0.05
# Only the Cable-DSL pair have no significant differences in the revenue generated

# As the number of categories or groups increases, the no. of pairs and tests increase quadratically.
# The higher the number of tests, the higher the chance of having at least one False Positive result.

# True Positive (TP): Correctly classified infected individuals
# False Positive (FP): Incorrectly classified non-infected individuals as infected
# True Negative (TN): Correctly classified non-infected individuals
# False Negative (FN): Misclassified infected individuals


# For example, if there are 3 pairwise comparisons and the significance level is 0.05, then the false positive rate would be:
# FP = (1 - 1/3) * 0.05 = 0.1667



# To address this, modify the pairwise t-tests to use Bonferroni p-value adjustment to reduce the reduce the likelihood
# of getting a False Positive.

# The Bonferroni correction is calculated by dividing the significance level by the number 
# of comparisons being made. For example, if the significance level is 0.05 and there are 10 comparisons being made, 
# then the Bonferroni-corrected significance level would be 0.005.

# This means that each comparison would need to be significant at the 0.005 level in order to be 
# considered statistically significant. The Bonferroni correction can be used with any type of 
# statistical test, but it is most commonly used with pairwise t-tests.
